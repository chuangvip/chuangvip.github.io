Hi here, I'm Chuang CHEN!  I received my Masterâ€™s degree from Anhui University in 2024, supervised by Prof. [Zhenzhen Tu](https://cs.ahu.edu.cn/2021/1216/c20807a277181/page.htm). From 2022 to 2024, I was a visiting student at the Institute of Artificial Intelligence, Hefei Comprehensive National Science Center, under the supervision of Prof. [Xiao Sun](https://faculty.hfut.edu.cn/sunxiao/zh_CN/index.htm) and Prof. [Meng Wang](https://faculty.hfut.edu.cn/wm12/zh_CN/index/198449/list/index.htm). Now, I am seeking a full-time Ph.D. position in Computer Science or Artificial Intelligence. 

My research primarily focuses on **visual sentiment analysis** and **skeleton-based gait emotion recognition**. The ultimate objective of my research is to equip machines with human-like emotional intelligence, including emotion recognition, understanding, and interaction.
